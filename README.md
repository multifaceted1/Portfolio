# Portfolio
A portfolio of my websites, and a little about me.
This project was made using React. One benefit of React is the speed in which a page can load. You can see here that this mimics a multipage site while in reality it only requires one html page.  This site has a js file for the header and the footer. It uses router to change between the different "pages" using a list which I made into buttons in the navbar. The websites page has descriptions of my websites with a link to each of them.
